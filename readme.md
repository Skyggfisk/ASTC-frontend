# ASTC Front End

This is the front end project for the Aalborg Storcenter (ASTC) web application. The main goal is to display shops that sell a specific item on a map to help the user find the item.
There are a few restrictions and requirements placed on this project:

- [x] The front end must be built using HTML/CSS and JavaScript
- [x] Only plain (vanilla) JavaScript should be used
- [x] It should be a progressive web app
- [x] It must consume a web API the team has created

The project is hosted on github pages at https://skyggfisk.github.io/ASTC-frontend :squirrel:

The back end project (web API) can be found [here](https://github.com/NandorRacz/ASTCwebapp).
